    <div class="Runaway-Breakdown">
        <p>In first place, I have Runaway from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. In this track, Kanye talks about his high opinion of himself and how he will likely never change, and that those close to him should "run away" or else risk being hurt by him.</p>
     </div>
     <br>
     <div class="Heartless-Breakdown">
        <p>In second place, I have Heartless from 808s & Heartbreak. In this track, Kanye reflects upon a toxic relationship he was once trapped in as well as how we deal with loss.</p>
     </div>
    <br>
    <div class="Father-Stretch-Breakdown">
        <p>In third place, I have Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1 from Life of Pablo. This track was an ode to his father, Ray West, who divorced Kanye's mother Donda over financial issues, as the song suggests.</p>
     </div>
    <br>
    <div class="Flashing-Lights-Breakdown">
        <p>In fourth place, I have Flashing Lights from Graduation. In this track, Kanye speaks about the struggles of being famous and the fast-paced lifestyle that accompanies fame. He also speaks about how his relationships have been strained by his glamorous lifestyle.</p>
     </div>
    <br>
    <div class="Gold-Digger-Breakdown">
        <p>Last but certainly not least, I have Gold Digger from Late Registration. In this track, Kanye talks about "gold diggers," which are women who only want men for their money and will often use deception to accomplish her goals. Kanye warns against gold diggers and preaches practicing caution when it comes to mixing women with money.</p>
